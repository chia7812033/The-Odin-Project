    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>These white chocolate coated cheesecake truffles are decorated to look like cute little polar bear faces! They
        take a bit of time to make, but are a great special occasion treat!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>⅓ cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups finely ground graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>12 ounces white chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>40 white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>20 white candy melts</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chocolate chips</li>
        <li>20 mini candy-coated chocolate pieces (such as mini M&Ms®)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps: </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream together cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, almond extract, salt, and nutmeg in a bowl with an
            electric mixer until smooth. Mix in graham cracker crumbs until thoroughly combined. Cover and refrigerate,
            about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove truffle filling mixture from fridge. Scoop out 1 tablespoon
            truffle filling and roll into a ball. Place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining filling.
            Place pan back in the fridge, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place chopped white chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl. Microwave white chocolate at 50% power until
            melted, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove truffle balls from fridge. Use a fork to lower a truffle filling ball into the melted white
            chocolate, and thoroughly coat with the chocolate. Lift out of the chocolate and gently tap to remove
            excess. Place back onto the parchment lined baking sheet. Gently press a white chocolate candy melt to the
            front of the truffle to make the bear's muzzle, and hold in place for a few seconds to adhere. Place two
            white chocolate chips on the top of the truffle to make the ears. Repeat with remaining truffles. Allow the
            truffles to harden at room temp for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dark chocolate chips into a small microwave-safe bowl, and microwave at 50% power until melted, about
            1 minute, stirring every 30 seconds. Pour chocolate into a piping bag, and snip a small hole at the end.
            Pipe two eyes onto the truffles, just above the muzzle. Place a small dot of melted chocolate onto the white
            candy melt, and attach the mini chocolate coated candy to make the nose; hold in place for a few seconds to
            adhere. Repeat with remaining truffles.</li>
        <li>Place truffles back into fridge to set up, at least 30 minutes. Serve immediately, or keep stored in the
            fridge for up to 5 days.</li>
    </ol>
